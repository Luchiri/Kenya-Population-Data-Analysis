# Kenya Population Data Analysis

This project analyzes Kenya's population and socio-economic indicators over time using data from the World Bank. It provides insights into demographic trends and economic indicators through visualizations and tabular summaries.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains information on various indicators such as:
- Total population
- Urban population percentage
- Age distribution (by gender and age groups)
- Merchandise exports and imports
- Population dependency ratios

The project focuses on:
1. Cleaning and reshaping the dataset.
2. Extracting population-specific data.
3. Visualizing trends over time with charts.
4. Presenting tabular summaries for clear understanding.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional, for advanced visualizations)

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Dropped empty columns and reorganized the dataset for easier analysis.
- **Population Trends:** Line plots showing Kenyaâ€™s population growth over time.
- **Demographic Insights:** Age group distributions and urban population percentage.
- **Economic Indicators:** Basic summaries of merchandise exports and imports.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Luchiri/Kenya-Population-Data-Analysis.git>
    ```
2. Open the `Kenya_population_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to see the tables, charts, and analysis.

## Sample Visuals

- Population over time line chart
- Age distribution tables and plots
- Merchandise trade trends

## Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from [World Bank Kenya Population Indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/).

## Future Enhancements

- Interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.
- Additional analyses for other socio-economic indicators.
- Comparative analysis with other East African countries.
